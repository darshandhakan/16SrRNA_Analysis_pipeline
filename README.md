# 16SrRNA_Analysis_pipeline

The pipeline is used to run 16SrRNA Analysis and generate the relevant tables and plots from the 16SrRNA amplicon datasets:

The SIF image to run 16SrRNA is provided as below:

This script takes as input:
1. The biom file containing the OTU abundance across samples (generated through Qiime1 or Qiime2)
2. The tree file containing thr phylogenetic distances of the OTUs
3. The sample metadata file containing the Grouping information of each of the samples used for 16SrRNA analysis
